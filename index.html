 <p>Welcome to my website! My name is Bonnie Wu and I am currently a junior in the computer science program at Texas A&M!</p>

 <p>As a child, I loved group work and loved wondering and asking about anything that had piqued my curiosity. This has persisted throughout my academic career, as in class, I am earnest, curious, and work well in teams! Plus, I am flexible and enthusiastic about learning new things. I am interested in just about anything and everything . . . except maybe bugs.</p>
  
  <p>Most of my time is spent studying and coding, but in my free time, I enjoy baking (not cooking), bouldering, and grabbing food with my friends. <del>I also have a crippling addiction to pokemon go</del> </p>
  
  <p>I started baking very frequently during the pandemic and it has persisted as a kind of therapy for me! I also tried cooking but I chronically burn or undercook food, and I dislike the prep work like chopping vegetables or peeling garlic. On the other hand, when baking, I love testing out new recipes and tweaking them to my tastes! I also have a sweet tooth so being able to have dessert whenever I want is great! Some of my favorite recipes are <a href="https://natashaskitchen.com/crepe-cake-recipe/">crepe cakes</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ed_0pLggDvM?si=dPu3eUiptrLhj_WG">custard buns</a>, and <a href="https://tasty.co/recipe/the-best-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies">chocolate chip cookies</a>!</p>
  
  <p>I started bouldering when I came to TAMU. I saw the bouldering wall at the recreation center, decided to try it, and the rest is history! I now go to Stone Co, College Station's local bouldering gym, and love it! Bouldering is a great way to make friends and get some exercise.</p>
  
  <p>Lastly, I have always grown up around food, and my family and family friends have always used food and potlucks as a time for bonding and closeness. Even simple things such as eating around the table as a family. I use the same concept when catching up with friends or to make new ones! That is why getting food with my friends is one of my favorite pastimes and one I hold very close to my heart.</p>
